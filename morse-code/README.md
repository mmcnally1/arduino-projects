## Arduino Morse Code Decoder  
### Morse Code
Morse code is a method of encoding characters using signal duration. It was commonly used to send messages by telegraph, and is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph. The two basic units of time measurement in Morse Code are the "dot" (dit) and the "dash" (dah). Each letter in the alphabet is encoded as a unique sequence of dots and dashes, which allows for easy decoding. A dash is 3 times as long as a dot, and a space the length of a dash serves to separate the letters in a word.
